## "Binge Learn your way to Success"

ðŸ¦… **Birds Eye View**:

Binge Learn is a revolutionary platform made for students who thrive on video-based learning. It offers the flexibility to binge-watch educational content at their own pace. What sets us apart is our unique selling proposition (USP) - prioritising content security for educators. With our platform, educators retain complete control over their content. They can assign specific viewing times to videos, ensuring that they expire after a set period. This prevents multiple viewings on the same account. If students need more time, they can request an extension.
